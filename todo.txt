TODO
------------------

- player registered, the date showed Nov XX -0001 ???
	when I went to the invite page, the player got deleted due to
	45 days or whatever... so find out why date is so far out of whack

- send email on player registration approval

- admin player delete is failing, fix it

- sync fixes from pharaoh, as well as new layout

- don't send out "your turn" email after opponent resignation

- port ajax_helper to ajax functions and only have logic switches
	in ajax_helper file

- store finished games

- emails are still sending improper data
	- started is showing game creators name
		may need to split the call to change the name for each

- don't show success messages if email is not sent

- preserve spaces in chats (copy code from messages) (port to WR)

- search for TODO and fix all found
